# last-hour-flower
Source code for the VN game [Last Hour for a Flower"](http://www.algorithmicallyanimated.com/games/lasthour/). The visual assets are missing so this code is currently only useful as a reference. I may add something to get it working later. Additionally, the included script is only a test script, rather than the original game script.
